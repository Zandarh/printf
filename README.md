This is a printf project done in collaboration between Alexander Ubaka and Philip Ojediran as part of a group project in ALX software Engineering program.

We will building our own printf() fuction that will called _printf() tht will act exactly like the printf() function.

The prototype for the _printf() that performs output conversion and print data is...

int _printf(const char *format, ...);
